Array ADT
    Array is a basic data structure provided by almost every programming language 
like C, C++ provides Array as a basic structure. So representation of array is 
given by the compiler but operation isn't. Now the operation in array is not 
given by the compiler, we are supposed to provide operation that can be performed 
in Array. So data structure and a set of operations together, we can call it as ADT.



Prerequities:
Declaring an array: 
    1. int a[10] if index is known. (Static)
    2. int *a;
        a = (int *)malloc(n * sizeof(int)); if index is not known.  (Dynamic)

Size of an array:
    - number of index of an array is called size of an array.

Length of an array:
    - number of elements in an array is called lenght of an array.



Operations on Array
    - Display()
    - Add(x) / Append(x)
    - Insert(index, x)
    - Delete(index)
    - Search(x)
    - Get(index)
    - Set(index, x)
    - Max() / Min()
    - Reverse()
    - Shift() / Rotate(x)
